## Abstract from report

This project investigates the development of a software system designed for a pharmaceutical company.
The report will focus on how to build a software system by the use of design patterns and development methods. Scrum and pair programming, which are agile development methods, have been used throughout the entire project.
Furthermore, this study will account for the stakeholders requirements by dividing them into the FURPS+ model. Secondly GRASP, Singleton, DTO and DAO patterns will give a better understanding on how to design a robust program with no failures and errors. Finally, the software system has been tested with JUnit and different kinds of test methods such as black box and white box testing.
The result show that almost all requirements from the stakeholders have been achieved. The development method is very important to have when a software system is being developed. Design patterns indicate that it is much easier to design and distribute responsibilities to the different classes in the system. Scrum meetings and pair programming is an effective working process to cooperate in groups.
